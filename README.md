# Satround - NOAA APT Decoder for Android

Decode analog APT signals from NOAA weather satellites with your mobile phone.

> [!NOTE]  
> This application is an attempt to port an APT decoder to mobile devices. The decoding script is written in Python and does not work in all cases. Any help in developing and improving the application is very welcome.

The mobile application is developed with Python and Kivy with (KivyMD), I know it's not the best alternative, but it's what I can get my hands on. The decoding script is based on the [NOOA Decoder](https://github.com/mimimaki/NOAA_decoder) project by [@mimimaki](https://github.com/mimimaki), thank you very much for that.
